jungle steal (check iKalista if only on key press)

more e <> vs more kite


    +Custom target selection based on the spears stuck in the enemy
    #If no enemy is in range, kite by attacking minions if that's faster than walking
    +    If the enemy has a spear, try attacking minions that are killable with 1 auto + e, so you can slow the enemy and get the reset
    +More e usage: Use e in a teamfight if you can get the reset (because hurricane attacked a minion + it's killable ...), but only if it will do more DPS than a autoattack and the e stack it applies
    +Prefer target with W passive (also adds to custom target selection ...)
    #Display AA count until killable (or %)
    Smart e when about to die AND enemy is not killable until death for sure
    Smart auto w
    #Check flying AA's and pre-rend
    Q jungle mobs/minions with many stacks into an enemy (hotkey ?)
    Draw e damage on jungle mob health bar (only big mobs ?)
    Better Q prediction
    Custom farm hotkey that stacks on multiple minions and kills them with e later
