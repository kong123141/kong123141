Check W - Q combo: q cast before w applies
Check Ignite
Check Bridge
Check Q casting 0.1 sec before passive gone














## old

r logic: random rng ult before death if maximum hits could kill
harass toggleable  -- dunno dont like it
optimal range/target for each skill, should it even switch targets? -- seems okay now, could still do better tho
fix damage indicator -- done, could use more logic at ult (two object bounce -> more dmg) but that would be perf intense and pretty unnesecary
fix skills sometimes not casting (after cc?)  -- couldnt fully reconstruct ## its always in a situation where W is down and QE up, dunno
Un-target passive dead ppl
Ignite heal ppl (low health adc?)

Movement predicition in R logic, so the bounces work better

before going live:
customizeable target selection range

w prediction off
r bounce check ults near minions (kinda max range) (maybe add virtual range on ult bounce)
e sometimes not casting!?!??!
